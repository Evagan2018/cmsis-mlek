# CMSIS-MLEK Software Pack

This repository contains **Machine Learning Evaluation Kit (MLEK)** pack which provides [CMSIS Reference Applications](https://open-cmsis-pack.github.io/cmsis-toolbox/ReferenceApplications/) and templates for Edge AI development. These applications implement data preprocessing, memory management, and neural network inference pipelines that are optimized for Cortex-M and Ethos-U platforms. The examples are prepared to run with [Keil Studio for VS Code](https://www.keil.arm.com/).

The CMSIS-MLEK software pack is derived from the [Arm® ML embedded evaluation kit](https://git.gitlab.arm.com/artificial-intelligence/ethos-u/ml-embedded-evaluation-kit) and makes the examples easier to access. It also contains interfaces to physical hardware and simplifies porting to target hardware. It contains the following ML applications and uses currently Neural Network Models currently in [TensorFlow Lite](https://www.keil.arm.com/packs/tensorflow-lite-micro-tensorflow) format.

### Issues and Labels

Please feel free to raise an [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/ARM-examples/cmsis-mlek/issues)
to report misbehavior (i.e. bugs) or start discussions about enhancements. This
is your best way to interact directly with the maintenance team and the community.
We encourage you to append implementation suggestions as this helps to decrease the
workload of the very limited maintenance team.
